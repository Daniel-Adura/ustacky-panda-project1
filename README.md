# Project Title Here

## This project seeks to draw inferences from the data of XYZ company's Branches

# Project Steps

To-Do - Explain in detail, the project steps and overview of different tasks completed here.
- The first step was to combine the data from the 3 Branches so as to do a somewhat descriptive research from the data.
- Next, I examined if the combined data were in the right order. and I ensured there were no un-recognized values like NaN in the dataset.
- Then, I computed the performance of each Branches based on their gross income - Port harcourt did best.
- After this, I visualized the payment method used most by the customers - it was a tie between Cash and Epay
- I examine the frequency of sales (note this is not the same as the quantity) using the countplot. Fashion accessories were the most frequently sold items not necessarily the highest quantity. More like, for Fashion Accessories customers came to buy over 1000 times, while for health and beauty accessories customers only came to buy more than 800 times.
- A number of other visualizations were done, such as comparing the prices and quantity per product line, and I discovered that Electronic accessories which has the lowest prices had the most sales while Fashion accessories which has the highest price had the lowest quantity.

# Insights

To-Do - Explain the insights you were able to uncover from the analysing the datasets.
- when it comes to food and beverages, Port harcourt made the most sales.
- when it comes to fashion accessories, Abuja made the most sales.
- when it comes to sports and travels, Port harcourt made the most sales.
- when it comes to electronics, Lagos made the most sales.
- Abuja branch has the least rating by customers.
- Lagos and port harcourt were rated relatively better than Abuja.

# Future Work

- With more knowledge I would be able to make predictions on what could be done to achieve management's goals of say profit and sales maximization, cost minimization etc.

# Standout Section

To-Do - Explain what you did differently in the project following the instructions in the notebook.

- I examined the correlation between the unit price and the gross income or gain on each of the transaction. As expected, there is a direct positive relationship between the Unit price and the profit or Gross income. Put simply, with every #1 increase in price, there would be a corresponding #0.63 increase in Gross income

Re: Data Analysis of the three Branches

- Here are some things to consider:
    * Port Harcourt is the most profitable branch followed by Lagos then Abuja.
    * With every #1 increase in prices of Goods there is an increase in the gross income by #0.63. Note that this is only useful to the degree that it does not affect the quantity sold. Seems this could however be applied for the Health and Beauty accessories as the high price does not really lead to a lower quantity
